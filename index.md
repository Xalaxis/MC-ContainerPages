## Docker containers for Feed The Beast (FTB) ModPacks

These containers are all created based on my https://github.com/Xalaxis/CreeperHostPackInstaller image.

The :latest tag automatically updates to the latest version available of each Modpack once daily. Even if no new version is available, the image is rebuilt to ensure underlying container updates are propagated.

It is a long term goal that :version tags will be made that track only specific versions of the packs.
